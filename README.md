## Task Description:
Your task is to implement form validation for various form fields on a website. You will be working on different types of forms such as contact forms and login forms. The primary goal is to validate form inputs using JavaScript to ensure correct data entry. This involves checking for empty fields, validating email addresses, enforcing password strength requirements, and any other relevant validations you deem necessary.

## Requirements:
1. Implement form fields for at least two types of forms (e.g., contact form, login form).
2. Use JavaScript to validate form inputs.
3. Ensure that the validation covers common scenarios such as empty fields, correct email formats, and any specific requirements based on the form type.
4. Provide clear and user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs.
5. Ensure that the form validation is responsive and works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

## Approach:
* Created three forms: a contact form and a login form and registration form.
* Used JavaScript to validate form inputs.
* Ensured validation covers empty fields, correct email formats, and specific requirements based on the form type.
